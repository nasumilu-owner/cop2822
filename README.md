# COP2822 - Internet Programming 1

## Description
This course covers intermediate client-side scripting using JavaScript, and XML and a brief introduction to server-side scripting using PHP. The emphasis of this course will be on syntax and debugging, web form processing and data validation, using common programming structures, dynamic content using JavaScript and HTML, and working with objects and cookies. Students are expected to have a working knowledge of HTML5, CSS, and introductory programming concepts (variables, operators, decision structures, repetition structures, arrays, and methods).
